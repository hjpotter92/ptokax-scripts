The following commands have been made available to all users:

	+top [#Limit [<date>]]: Arguments #Limit and <date> are optional. If not passed, a limit of 10 and current date will be
	  assumed by default. The date passed must be of the type YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore 2013-07-29 and 2015-15-35 are both
	  valid (the second one will produce no output, of course).

	+topall [#Limit]: All time record holder's list. Previously, this was accessed by the top command.

The following command is available for all users, but result will be produced only for registered users. Unregistered users
may either receive an error or undesired behaviour.

	+see: To get statistics for self.

	+score <nick>: To fetch statistics of a registered user with nick as passed as arguments.
